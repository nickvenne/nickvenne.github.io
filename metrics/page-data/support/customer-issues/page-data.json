An ITS can help automate much of the documentation and status history.</p>\n\n<p>Having an idea of how many tickets are in your support queue, new ones being opened, and existing ones closed,&nbsp;can help you determine reasons for a high and low volume. If you have a low number of open tickets, this could indicate your support team has very efficient&nbsp;response times or that you don't have many issues/inquiries at that moment.</p>\n\n<p>A high number of open incidents&nbsp;could indicate your team is struggling to keep up with the volume of inquiries. This could be a lack of efficiency or perhaps necessitate&nbsp;hiring more support staff to keep up.</p>\n\n<p>Using this metric, especially with ratios such as Tickets Per Agent, or Tickets Per Customer will help assess the health of your team.&nbsp;</p>\n","summary":"Customer Issues, tickets, or incidents, refers to the capture of user or system initiated requests.
