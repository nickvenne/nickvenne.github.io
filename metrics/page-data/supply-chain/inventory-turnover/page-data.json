Using the COGS method produces a more accurate result because markup is not factored in.</p>\n\n<p>Average Inventory value is calculated by adding the starting and ending inventory together and dividing by two.</p>\n\n<p>Inventory turnover is an important indicator of the efficiency of your supply chain, the quality and demand of the inventory you carry, and if you have good buying practices. Generally speaking, a higher Inventory Turnover rate is better, while a lower Inventory Turnover rate suggests inefficiency and difficulty turning stock into revenue. Each type of industry will have different benchmarks and norms. For instance, a fresh produce supplier will have many more turns than a heavy equipment manufacturer.</p>\n","summary":"Inventory Turnover measures how often, in a given time-period, your organization is able to sell its entire inventory.
