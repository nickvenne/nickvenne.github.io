Unlike other <a href=\"/metrics/finance/revenue\">revenue</a> related metrics, ASP is highly visible to customers and needs to be understood and leveraged by both marketing and sales. It can be an effective way for sales executives to compare how different parts of their team are performing. ASP can vary significantly between companies and segments (such as target users and geography).</p>\n\n<p>For SaaS companies, ASP is the average price a new customer pays when they first subscribe to the service.
