It’s measured by surveying customers after a specific interaction, and asking them to rate how easy or difficult it was to do what they wanted to do. Examples of difficult or high-effort interactions are ones that add friction for customers, for example, making them repeat information, interact with multiple people or screens, or wade through generic content to find information relevant to them.","field_formula":["Average (Customer Effort Score)"],"field_benchmark":"CES score will vary, since different companies ask slightly different survey questions or use slightly different survey scales. On the most commonly used 7 point Likert scale, where 7 is the lowest effort, a score of 5 or above is a good score.","field_example":null,"body":{"processed":"<p>Why does CES matter? It matters because effort turns out to be a better indicator of customer loyalty than customer happiness or delight. And the more loyal a customer is, the more likely they are to give you referrals, and the less likely they are to churn. Reducing customer effort is a big deal because when customers have an issue and need to resolve it, out of the gate they’re four times more likely to become disloyal. So the real opportunity is to avoid creating disloyal customers who speak negatively about your product and your brand. Gartner research has shown that when you give customers a low-effort experience, only 9% of them become disloyal, compared to 96% who become more disloyal in a high-effort experience.</p>\n\n<p>And as an added bonus, reducing the effort your customers need to exert to accomplish their task often reduces your own cost of supporting or servicing customers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When to use it</strong><br />\nAfter a specific interaction a customer has with your company</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recommended survey methodology</strong><br />\nProvide a statement, not a question, along with a 7 point Likert scale, where 1 is very difficult and 7 is very easy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pros</strong><br />\nHelps uncover points of friction in specific customer interactions</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Can provide actionable insight if a follow up question is used</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">40% more accurate at predicting customer loyalty as opposed to Customer Satisfaction (CSAT), according to Gartner research.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Cons</strong><br />\nMay show low score based on one interaction, which may not be reflective of the health of the overall relationship</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Can be difficult to segment by customer</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Key considerations for successful use</strong><br />\nOptimize for mobile</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Trigger surveys automatically&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Keep the question simple</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Action the results internally and with clients</p>\n","summary":"Customer Effort Score (CES) is a measure of how easy or difficult it is for customers to interact with your company."},"relationships":{"field_related_metrics":[{"field_metricname":"Net Promotor Score","field_description":"Net Promoter Score or NPS® is a measure of a customer base's willingness to promote a product or service to colleagues and friends.
