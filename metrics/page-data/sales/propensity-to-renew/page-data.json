It is most often collected through a customer survey, along with other measures that assess expected behavioural loyalty indicators, such as propensity to increase spend, propensity to add more products/solutions, and propensity to recommend.  </p>\n<p>At an aggregate level, it is an indicator that is reviewed by executives to provide a forward-looking view of potential revenue risk and potential logo churn.  At a customer level, it is an indicator reviewed by account managers and/or customer success leads as they work to secure renewals.  </p>\n<p>Because the metric is provided by the customer, and in more complex relationships, from multiple contacts within a customer account, it can highlight risk that may be masked by relying on more standard operational predictors of churn such as customer complaints or late payments.  For example, a customer may report a lower propensity to renew because of knowledge they have of other changes in the business, such as a consolidation of suppliers or new executive direction. In instances where the customer-provided risk is higher than expected, a review of the metric early enough in advance of the renewal date can allow for effective intervention strategies and saved business.</p>\n<p>Note that Propensity to Renew is considered an outcome measure, so while it serves as a leading indicator for risk, it is a lagging indicator of poor customer experiences in one or more of the day-to-day interactions a customer has with your product or your people.  Low or declining scores should trigger a deeper analysis of underlying experiences to identify and remediate weak spots, either for an individual customer or more systemically.</p>\n<p>As companies build time-series data for this metric, it should be aligned with actual renewal data to enable more predictive modeling of risk.</p>\n<p><strong>When to use it</strong></p>\n<p>As part of a cadenced review of business and/or account health. </p>\n<p>At the business level, at least quarterly; at the account level, typically 60-90 days pre-renewal date.</p>\n<p><strong>How to gather it</strong></p>\n<p>This metric is most often gathered through a regular voice of customer survey, in cases where your customers have a defined renewal date.  Best practice is to survey one quarter prior to the renewal date to inform the strategy for renewal and position for growth.</p>\n<p>Keep it simple. Ask a question like: Based on your experience over the last six months, how likely are you to renew your contract? </p>\n<p>Provide clear response options.  I recommend a 5-point labelled scale, which has been proven to have less variation in the interpretation of responses, such as: Extremely Likely, Very Likely, Somewhat Likely, Not Very Likely, Not At All Likely.  You may prefer a 7-point Likert scale (a range from 1 to 7 where 7 is the most likely to renew), or for a more binary view, reword the question to elicit a Yes/No answer.  Best practice is to ensure the scale you use aligns with other scaling in your survey - this makes it easier for customers to respond, and easier for employees to interpret results.</p>\n","summary":"Propensity to Renew is a measure of the likelihood a customer will renew their contract instead of terminating their engagement with a company, most often provided by the customer as part of a survey.
