NPS can be an especially important metric to organizations focused on growth through account expansion or <a href=\"/metrics/marketing/referrals\">referrals</a> - the “Viral Engine of Growth” in Eric Ries’ terms.</p>\n\n<p>Net promoter scoring should start by answering two related questions: (1) why are we asking? and (2) what will we do with this information? Most organizations will use an initial NPS survey as a benchmark, and track subsequent NPS surveys to measure ebbs and flows in customer sentiment over time. Having clear visibility into changes in NPS over time enables action when customer satisfaction/loyalty drops significantly. A climbing NPS score is an indication that customer experiences are improving, so you should keep doing what you’re doing.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the best insights and the most powerful benefits of net promoter scoring come when you combine NPS with related KPIs such as <a href=\"/metrics/saas/logo-churn\">Customer Retention Rate</a> and Customer Referral Rate. If NPS has been falling for the past two quarters, you should expect to see a climb in customer churn and a reduction in account expansions and referrals. On the other hand, as NPS climbs, you would expect to see rising customer referral, retention and expansion rates. Measuring the relationships between these metrics can help optimize performance over time.</p>\n","summary":"Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a measure of customer satisfaction and loyalty.
