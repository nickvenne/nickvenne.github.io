It is typically used by subscription-based businesses.</p>\n\n<p>Tracking trends in ARR gives a good overview of the general health of your business, indicating where <a href=\"/metrics/finance/revenue\">revenue</a> is increasing or decreasing. ARR is an accurate way to monitor the changes in the business as it relates to new or <a href=\"/metrics/saas/logo-churn\">lost subscriptions</a>, renewals, upgrades or downgrades.</p>\n\n<p>ARR is useful in forecasting revenue from potential customers because it is a stable measure and is expected to continue in the future, allowing leadership to manage expenses and resources. Longer term contracts, where churn has been proven to be less than with shorter term subscriptions, are particularly attractive to investors as they signal future financial stability.</p>\n\n<p>ARR is measured using only committed subscriptions or recurring fees. Variable or one time fees are not included in this calculation.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to tracking ARR, Lifetime Value of a subscription customer is key as well. Lifetime Value does not limit the revenue to a single month or year, but rather calculates a theoretical lifetime revenue value for a customer, based on known churn rates.</p>\n","summary":"Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is the sum of all subscription revenue expressed as an annual value."},"relationships":{"field_related_metrics":[{"field_metricname":"Monthly Recurring Revenue","field_description":"Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) is the sum of all subscription revenue expressed as a monthly value.
