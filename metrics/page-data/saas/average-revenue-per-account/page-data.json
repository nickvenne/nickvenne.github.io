Most industries are looking for an increase in the ARPA over time. Changes in ARPA can be a reflection of changes in prices, expansion or contraction within accounts, or even changes in initial purchases.</p>\n\n<p>Comparing ARPA trends for different segments of accounts may also provide useful insights. For example, if you are focused on increasing overall revenue and want to increase the initial purchase value for new accounts, watching the trend of ARPA for new accounts gives great insight into progress towards your goal.
