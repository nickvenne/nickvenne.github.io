Early stage companies are generally considered to be fairly healthy with a SaaS Quick Ratio of 4 or higher, but there is no hard and fast rule on this.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this ratio so important? Without factoring in the SaaS Quick Ratio you are more likely to be obsessed at adding Net New MRR at all cost. Fuelling the growth of a business with a low SaaS Quick Ratio is like filling up a gas tank that has holes in it. A company with a SaaS Quick Ratio of 2 is essentially losing half of its new <a href=\"/metrics/saas/monthly-recurring-revenue\">MRR</a> every month. Considering it can easily take 12+ months to recover new <a href=\"/metrics/finance/customer-acquisition-cost\">customer acquisition costs</a> this business requires much more cash to grow than a comparable business with a higher SaaS Quick Ratio.</p>\n\n<p>How do you fix a low SaaS Quick Ratio? If your company has a strong MRR growth rate but a low SaaS Quick Ratio you need to prioritize customer retention.
