It's also vital to build expansion opportunities into your customer's buying journey, as this, and this alone, is essential to help you overcome the downward forces of <a href=\"/metrics/saas/gross-mrr-churn-rate\">Gross Churn</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It's well known that selling to existing customers is significantly less costly than acquiring new customers. KeyBanc's Annual SaaS survey concluded that cross-sells and add-ons cost about 1/4 of what $1 of new revenue costs, and natural plan expansions cost as little as 1/5 of what it costs to acquire a new customer.</p>\n\n<p>This all impacts your <a href=\"/metrics/saas/cac-payback-period\">CAC Payback Period</a> - your time to profitability - which for any cash strapped startup is a key early survival tactic. And, of course, if you can increase the amount each customer is paying you, then <a href=\"/metrics/saas/customer-lifetime-value\">Lifetime Value (LTV)</a> increases as well.</p>\n\n<p>The most efficient and fastest growing companies spend a lot of time understanding how to benefit from&nbsp;healthy Expansion MRR. Everything is easier when you can count on your customer base contributing to your top line. Best in class companies are achieving Expansion MRR Ratios that are 20% to 40% of top line revenue each month.</p>\n","summary":"Expansion Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) Growth Rate is the velocity at which additional revenue from existing customers is being added to the business, expressed as a percentage of total MRR."},"relationships":{"field_related_metrics":[{"field_metricname":"MRR Growth Rate","field_description":"Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) Growth Rate is the velocity at which MRR is being added to the business, expressed as a percentage.
