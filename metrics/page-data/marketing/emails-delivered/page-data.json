Emails <a href=\"/metrics/marketing/emails-opened\">opened</a>, <a href=\"/metrics/marketing/email-forwards\">forwarded</a>, and <a href=\"/metrics/marketing/email-click-rate\">clicked through</a> metrics depend on deliverability.</p>\n\n<p>Regulations, technologies, global misuse, and recipient behaviour are all making deliverability more difficult. Here are some ways to improve your deliverability rates:</p>\n\n<p>1. Ensure your emails aren't being perceived as spam and let ISPs know you are a legitimate business by authenticating your emails.<br />\n2. Improve every engagement metric by asking your recipients for \"confirmed\" or \"double opt-in\" and configure your email rules to stop sending to low engagement users.<br />\n3. Don't send your emails using a free domain, such as Hotmail, Yahoo, or Gmail.<br />\n4. Always ensure quality is front and centre. Don't use click-baity subject lines or overuse images or buttons.<br />\n5. Keep everything transparent, including all of your header information and links. Don't obscure links with URL shorteners.<br />\n6. And, because it's the law, make it really easy to <a href=\"/metrics/marketing/email-unsubscribes\">unsubscribe</a>.
