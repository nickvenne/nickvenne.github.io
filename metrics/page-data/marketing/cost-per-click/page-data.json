Search, which displays advertisements within the context of search engine result pages, is a high-intent, higher-cost advertising medium. Display has a broader context in that ads will get seen significantly more but, because user intent is weaker, <a href=\"/metrics/marketing/click-through-rate\">Click Through Rates (CTR)</a> will be lower. As a result, CPC for Display will be lower than for Search.</p>\n\n<p>It’s important to know what type of visibility or clicks you are aiming for.
