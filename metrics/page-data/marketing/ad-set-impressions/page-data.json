Think of Ad Set Impressions as the total number of times that ads within a chosen ad set have shown up on someone’s screen. If a single person saw your ad 4 times, they would count as 4 impressions. If 4 people saw your ad once, they would also count as 4 impressions.</p>\n\n<p>The number of impressions you receive can vary based on the size of your audience, size of your budget, relevance of your ads, quality score, and a variety of other factors. If you want to increase this metric, it may be as easy as raising your ad set budget or as involved as redesigning all of your ad assets to be more relevant to the audience.</p>\n\n<p>More advanced digital advertisers will also use impressions to evaluate their impression share, adjust their bid strategies, and diagnose any problems related to the delivery of their ads.</p>\n","summary":"Ad Set Impressions is the total number of times digital advertisements within an ad set are shown.
