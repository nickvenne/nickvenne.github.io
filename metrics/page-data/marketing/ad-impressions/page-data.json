For a single ad, you can see how many times the ad has shown up on your audience’s screens. Impressions can be measured for search ads, display ads, video ads and almost all other ad formats.</p>\n\n<p>Impressions represent the total number of times your ad has been viewed. That means that if a single person saw your ad 4 times, they would count as 4 impressions. If 4 people saw your ad once, they would also count as 4 impressions.</p>\n\n<p>The number of impressions you receive can vary based on the size of your audience, size of your budget, relevance of your ad, quality score, and a variety of other factors. If you want to increase this metric, it may be as easy as raising your budget or as involved as redesigning all of your ads to be more relevant to the audience.</p>\n\n<p>More advanced digital advertisers will also use impressions across their campaigns and accounts to evaluate their impression share, adjust their bid strategies, and diagnose any problems related to the delivery of their ads.</p>\n","summary":"Ad Impressions (IMPR) is a count of the total number of times digital advertisements display on someone’s screen within the publisher's network."},"relationships":{"field_related_metrics":[{"field_metricname":"Ad Clicks","field_description":"Ad Clicks, or simply Clicks, is a marketing metric that counts the number of times users have clicked on a digital advertisement to reach an online property.","path":{"alias":"/marketing/ad-clicks","pid":170}},{"field_metricname":"Campaign Impressions","field_description":"Campaign Impressions is a count of the total number of times digital advertisements within a campaign are shown.
