Also, one time-based metric can be used to calculate another. For example, “Seconds Watched” can be divided by 60 to get “Minutes Watched”.<br />\n<br />\nYouTube is one of the primary video platforms providing a \"Video Watch Time\" metric. Because YouTube wants viewers to spend as much time as possible on their platform, it is widely known that their algorithm favors videos that have a higher \"Watch Time.\"</p>\n","summary":"Watch Time is a measurement of how much time has been spent watching a video (or a collection of videos).
