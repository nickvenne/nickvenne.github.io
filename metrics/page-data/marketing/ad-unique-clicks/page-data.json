You may see data that looks like this:\r\n\r\nAd 1:\r\nTotal Clicks: 14,000\r\nUnique Clicks: 10,000\r\n\r\nThis means that your ad has been clicked a total of 14,000 times by 10,000 different people. ","body":{"processed":"<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when evaluating Unique Clicks. A browser cookie is usually used to determine Unique Clicks. This means that if you have clicked on an ad, the ad network (like Facebook) has registered that you have clicked. If you click again, it would still count you as a single unique click unless the cookie has expired or been removed. As a result of this, it is possible for some Unique Clicks to be double counted. It is also possible that you could be double counted if you click on a specific ad on your phone and then click on that same ad from your laptop.</p>\n\n<p>This is still a very valuable metric&nbsp;to track, especially when you are tracking performance on smaller ad networks. If you are seeing a large, suspicious discrepancy between your Total Clicks and Unique Clicks then you may want to investigate the potential of ad fraud or inflated data.</p>\n","summary":"Ad Unique Clicks is a count of the number of people who clicked on your digital advertisement at least once."},"relationships":{"field_related_metrics":[{"field_metricname":"Ad Clicks","field_description":"Ad Clicks, or simply Clicks, is a marketing metric that counts the number of times users have clicked on a digital advertisement to reach an online property.","path":{"alias":"/marketing/ad-clicks","pid":170}},{"field_metricname":"Ad Impressions","field_description":"Ad Impressions (IMPR) is a count of the total number of times digital advertisements display on someoneâ€™s screen within the publisher's network.","path":{"alias":"/marketing/ad-impressions","pid":98}},{"field_metricname":"Ad Reach","field_description":"Ad Reach is a count of the number of people who viewed your ads at least once.
