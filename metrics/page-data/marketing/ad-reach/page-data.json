Reach can help you understand how many people have been exposed to a specific advertisement or marketing message.","field_formula":["Count(Ad Reach)"],"field_benchmark":null,"field_example":"Imagine that you are advertising to an audience of 100,000 people. Within a specific campaign, you may have 90,000 Impressions and a Reach of 45,000 (teh number of people who saw your ad at least once). ","body":{"processed":"<p>Reach is sometimes used to make estimates about the increases in brand awareness that come as a result of running ad campaigns. If your ad is reaching many new people, then your message is being put in front of those new audiences.</p>\n\n<p>When looking at Reach, it is important to consider the size of the available audience that you are advertising to. If you are running a very focused ad to an audience of 10,000 people, then don’t expect your reach to exceed the size of your audience. Meanwhile, if you are running ads with a large, broad audience then you can use Reach to understand the proportion of your audience that you’ve been able to reach with ads. Your ability to display ads to your whole audience will usually depend on your budget and the relevance of your advertisements.</p>\n\n<p>In the example, you can draw a few insights from this data. First, you will see that your ad has reached 45% of your total audience. This means that your ad has been displayed to&nbsp;45,000 individual people or devices. Depending on how much you have spent on your ads, this could be very good coverage.</p>\n\n<p>Second, you will notice that you have more Impressions than Reach. This is common as your ad will usually show more than 1 time to someone within your audience. This is expected and desired because it is rare that a single ad impression to a single person is going to have a material impact on your business. You want to make sure that you are getting a sufficient amount of Impressions. In this case, you have 90,000 Impressions which means that the average person has seen your ad twice. The measure of how often your audience has seen your ad is called Frequency.</p>\n","summary":"Ad Reach is a count of the number of people who viewed your ads at least once."},"relationships":{"field_related_metrics":[{"field_metricname":"Ad Impressions","field_description":"Ad Impressions (IMPR) is a count of the total number of times digital advertisements display on someone’s screen within the publisher's network.","path":{"alias":"/marketing/ad-impressions","pid":98}},{"field_metricname":"Advertising Costs","field_description":"Advertising Costs is a broad expense category, which typically includes online, broadcast, print, outdoor, and direct mail efforts.
