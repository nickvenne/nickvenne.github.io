It's a good habit to always treat each campaign as a test and to learn from the messaging you put in front of your audience. A high CTR is a good indication that your ad is compelling and your target market has a need.</p>\n\n<p>CTRs vary according to the value of your brand and from market to market. CTR is based on your budget and your ability to buy visibility. One clear example can be seen by comparing Search CTRs and Display CTRs. Display advertising, where you will generate lots of impressions, generally sees a CTR of 0.35%. Search advertising, where user intent is much higher, will see CTRs six times higher than Display.</p>\n\n<p>It’s important to follow through on the user's journey and fulfill the expectation the link promised. A great CTR is wasted if a user's expectations are not met when they follow your link.</p>\n","summary":"Click-Through Rate is the ratio of click on your link to the number of impressions your link generates.
